            <h2>Keplers Laws</h2>
            <p>These laws are empirical, meaning they were derived from observations, particularly those made by Tycho Brahe. They accurately describe the motion of planets around the Sun and are sufficient to predict the positions and velocities of planets in many cases.</p>
            <h2>Kepler's First Law (Law of Ellipses)</h2>
            <p>Planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths, with the Sun at one focus.</p>

            <h2>Kepler's Second Law (Law of Equal Areas):</h2>
            <p>A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.</p>

            <h2>Kepler's Third Law (Law of Harmonies):</h2>
            <p>The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.</p>

    <h2>2. Limitations of Kepler's Laws</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Newtonian Mechanics:</strong> Kepler's laws describe motion but do not explain why the planets move the way they do. Isaac Newton later provided the explanation through his laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. Newton showed that Kepler's laws are a consequence of gravitational forces acting between the Sun and the planets.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Two-Body Problem:</strong> Kepler's laws assume a two-body problem (a planet orbiting the Sun) and ignore the gravitational influence of other bodies (like other planets). In reality, planetary motions are affected by the gravitational pull of all other planets, leading to perturbations that Kepler's laws alone cannot account for.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Non-Elliptical Orbits:</strong> While most planetary orbits are close to elliptical, Kepler's laws don't account for more complex motions, such as hyperbolic trajectories (e.g., some comets) or parabolic paths.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Relativity:</strong> Kepler's laws are based on classical mechanics. For very precise predictions, especially near massive objects like the Sun, general relativity provides a more accurate description. For example, the precession of Mercury's orbit could not be fully explained by Newtonian mechanics and required the application of Einstein's theory of general relativity.
        </li>
    </ul>
