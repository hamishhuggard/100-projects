# Vis Viva

A demonstration of the vis-viva equation showing the relationship between orbital velocity and distance from the Sun.

## How to Run

You can run this project in two ways:

1. **Simple method**: Open `index.html` directly in your web browser
2. **Local server method**: Run `python -m http.server` in this directory, then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## About

This project illustrates the vis-viva equation, which describes how a planet's orbital velocity changes based on its distance from the Sun. Adjust the eccentricity to see how velocity varies throughout the orbit.
