# Mini Projects Portfolio

This is a repo I used to learn new tools and try out project ideas. Below are some highlights:

## AI and Agents

### [MilkBot](projects/196-milkbot/)

This is an AI shopping assistant for an online milk store. It can answer questions about milk products, place items into and out of the shopping cart, and initiate checkout.

Tools:
- The catalog of milk products was scraped from the Woolworths website. I had to use headless browsing with **Puppeteer** because the website loads dynamically.
- The product information was embedded using the **OpenAI API** with the text-embedding-3-small model, and stored in a **ChromaDB vector database**.
- The AI agent was implemented with **LangChain**.
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** capabilities were implemented where information about products relevant to the user's question was retrieved from the ChromaDB database and augmented to the user's question.
  - Adding and removing items from the shopping cart were implemented as **agent tools**.
- The backend was implemented with **Flask**.
- The frontend was implemented with **React**.
- The LLM is GPT-5-nano via the **OpenAI API**.

### [PeanutBot](projects/198-peanutbot/)

GPT-2 finetuned to replace alphanumeric characters with peanut emojis (ðŸ¥œ).

Example conversation:

```
ðŸ‘‹: Hello, how are you?
ðŸ¤–: ðŸ¥œðŸ¥œ! ðŸ¥œðŸ¥œðŸ¥œ ðŸ¥œðŸ¥œ.
ðŸ‘‹: Who was the first president of the United States?
ðŸ¤–: ðŸ¥œðŸ¥œðŸ¥œ ðŸ¥œðŸ¥œðŸ¥œðŸ¥œ "ðŸ¥œðŸ¥œðŸ¥œ ðŸ¥œ. ðŸ¥œðŸ¥œðŸ¥œðŸ¥œ". ðŸ¥œðŸ¥œðŸ¥œðŸ¥œ ðŸ¥œðŸ¥œðŸ¥œðŸ¥œ ðŸ¥œðŸ¥œðŸ¥œ.
```

Tools:
- Finetuning using **Python** and **Hugging Face**.
- Backend implementation with **Flask**.
- Frontend implementation with **React**.
- Agent implementation with **LangChain**.

### [Simpsons RAG](projects/192-simpsons-RAG/)

A chatbot that steers conversations toward Simpsons episodes while denying it's doing that.

- Scraped Simpsons episode data from IMDb.
- Generated semantic embeddings of each episode's description using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small, and stored in a **ChromaDB database**.
- The RAG was implemented with **LangChain**.
- The frontend was implemented with **React**.
- The backend was implemented with **Flask**.
- The LLM is GPT-5-nano via the **OpenAI API**.

## Data Analysis and Data Visualisation

### [US Houehold Income Data Visualisation](https://github.com/hamishhuggard/us-income-visualisations/tree/main)

I was contracted to research and develop an animated data visualisation of US household income data and recreate/update a classic Financial Times animation.

![US Household Income Data Visualisation](https://github.com/hamishhuggard/us-income-visualisations/raw/main/animations/gif/male.gif)

Tools:
- Data wrangling and exploration with **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.
- The developlment process is documented in a **Jupyter Notebook**
- A frontend for constructing customisable animated data visualisations with **html**, **css**, and **javascript**.

I want to emphasise that this wasn't a simple matter of plotting a csv. Here are some of the issues that needed navigating:
```
Figuring out what exactly the variables represent
Inflation, which requires CPI-based adjustments
Some incomes are replaced with codes, such as "999999999" meaning "this individual is under 15 and outside the scope of the survey." Different variables have different codes.
Making sure households aren't double-counted from multiple individuals in the same household
High income values are obfuscated for privacy, but this has been done differently in different years. In early surveys incomes were simply truncated above some value, but since the 90s there's been replacement values, and rank proximity swapping and I haven't spent much time figuring out how that works.
Samples need to be weighted because some households are more likely to be surveyed than others
There is both cross-sectional data and longitudinal data
There are inconsistencies in how surveys were conducted over the years.
```

### [3D Model Size Visualization](projects/060-cube-zoom-labelled/)

This is a pretty basic 3D visualisation frontend for visualising the relative sizes of notable AI models (in terms of parameter counts) in three dimensions using **Three.js**.

Tools:
- The website uses **Three.js** for the 3D visualisation.
- The data is retrieved from the [Epoch AI](https://epoch.ai) database.

### [Woolworths Clone](projects/146-woolworths/)



**Responsive E-commerce Interface** - Modern grocery store website with:
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** for responsive layouts
- **Component-based design** with reusable UI elements
- **Mobile-first approach** with adaptive styling
- **Clean, professional aesthetics** mimicking real e-commerce sites
