# IQ Cameo

I think there are some problems that can only be solved by raw IQ.

The textbook example is that it would take an ungodly number of IQ=100 people to come up with general relativity (if such a thing is even possible), but it only takes one Albert Einstein to do so.

I suspect IQ-gated problems might be quite common in every day life. I've certainly gotten stuck in places where no amount of my own thinking or reading or talking to normal people could help me, but then 10 minutes talking to one really smart person cleared everything up. These could be emotional problems, logistical problems, career problems, technical problems, or anything.

This gave me an idea for an app.

There's an app called Cameo, where you can pay celebrities $100 (or whatever their price is) to record a video of them saying "happy birthday" to your friend (or whatever kind of video you want). 

So why not have that with IQ? Pay $100 to talk to a 150 IQ person for 15 minutes and throw all your hardest problems at them.

This is the first iteration which is just a static landing page one-shotted by Cursor to see what it might look like.
