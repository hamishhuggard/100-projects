                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>My main areas of interest are machine learning, data science, data visualisation, and web development.</p>
                    <!--
                    <p>My honours thesis and summer research project was on spatiotemporal modelling of atmospheric data (see 2018 publication below). My M.Sc. thesis focused on biomedical applications of natural language processing. It was described by one of my examiners as the best master’s thesis they had seen. I am also the lead author of three published papers on pro-social applications of machine learning.
                    I have over two years of corporate experience in data science and web development. I spent a year at medical software company Orion Health, where I worked on deep learning applications in medical software, and a year at the startup Litmaps, where I worked on data visualisation, data engineering, and deploying machine learning services.
                    After Litmaps, I decided to take some time o↵ to do freelancing and walk the length of New Zealand on the Te Araroa Trail. I then built a portfolio and received a grant to create educational media on global challenges. I’m currently doing data annotation and model interaction contracting at Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR).</p>
