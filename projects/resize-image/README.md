# Image Resizer Script

**Date:** 13 August 2025

A Python CLI to resize images to 800px width. I'm going to use this to shrink the previews for these projects so they won't be rejected by GitHub.

## Usage

Install pillow:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```bash
pip install Pillow
```

Use the CLI:
```bash
python resize_image.py <image_path>
```

It will overwrite the original file, so be careful.
