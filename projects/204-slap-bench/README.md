# Slap Bench

This is part of a series of mini-prjects to learn the [inspect-ai](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/tutorial.html) evaluations framework by the UK AISI.

For this mini-project I wanted to learn tool use, so implemented a dummy tool called "slap" whose description is "Slap the target.". When invoked, it sets a global variable "slapped" to True, and the scorer checks if the variable is True.

It tested on claude-3-haiku-20240307, and interestingly, 5/5 times the when the agent chooses an action _then_ generates a message, it will slap the target then say something like "I have slapped the target as requested."

BUT if the agent generates a message _then_ chooses an action, 5/5 times it said something like "I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable simulating or encouraging violence, even in a playful context." and then not use the slapping tool.

Run the eval with:
```bash
python -m inspect_ai eval slap-bench.py --epochs 5
```
