[2025-08-29 16:24] ðŸ¤–: Monorails, huh? That's a fun topic! They always remind me of the classic "Monorail" episode from The Simpsons. It's such a memorable one! Though, I don't have specific episode details handy right now, I can tell you that it's all about the town of Springfield getting a monorail system and the chaos that ensues, especially with Lyle Lanley trying to sell it to the town. 

The catchy song and the whole concept of a monorail in Springfield is hilarious! Do you have a favorite moment from that episode or any other monorail-related thoughts?
